# Identifying and removing the sources of noise that limit LIGO’s range which enables higher signal-to-noise observations and increases the number of observations

Operating the LIGO detectors at the sensitivity needed for gravitaional-wave detection requires a large 
number of control loops and sensors to precisely control and monitor the instrumentaƟon and 
environment. The channels that continually record information from these sensors enable 
investigations into problematic variations in the sensitivity of the detector. However, due to the 
complexity of the system, the number of auxiliary sensor channels is roughly 500,000. Searching 
through such a large amount of data to determine which sensors are most highly correlated with 
variations in the range is a formidable yet important challenge.

I am working on a simple algorithm to identify correlations between the range of each
LIGO detector and thousands of LIGO’s auxiliary channels, based on Spearman and
Pearson correlation coefficients. The inputs to this algorithm are the binary neutron
star range of LIGO, sampled once per minute, and minute trends of all or a subset
of LIGO’s auxiliary channels. It calculates the Spearman and Pearson correlation
coefficient between each auxiliary channel and the range, and then produces a webpage
that ranks the channels by their highest overall correlation coefficient. For each channel,
it also provides graphs such as time series overlays and correlation scatter plots. This
algorithm, though very simple, is capable of identifying groups of channels that are
related to the sensitivity fluctuations of LIGO.
